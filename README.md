# executable-self-modifying-name
This code enables the generation of a random string consisting of X characters, which can be utilized to rename your executable file post-execution.

Implement the code in your project and have fun with newly generated names for your file after each run! 
It should work with other file extensions, but I have not tested any other than executable files.
